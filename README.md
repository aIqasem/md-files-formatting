## Headings [..](https://github.com/aIqasem/md-files-formatting#organizing-md-files-markdown-files)

- To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level.

```
# This is heading 1

## This is heading 2

### This is heading 3

```

_`Output`_

# This is heading 1

## This is heading 2

### This is heading 3

## Line Break [..](https://github.com/aIqasem/md-files-formatting#organizing-md-files-markdown-files)

- Best practice :

```
This is the 1st Line.<br>
And this is the 2nd one
```

_`Output`_

This is the 1st Line.<br>
And this is the 2nd one

<br/>

- This alse works .. but don't try it :

```
This is the 1st Line.<br>And this is the 2nd one
```

_`Output`_

This is the 1st Line.<br>And this is the 2nd one

## Styling [..](https://github.com/aIqasem/md-files-formatting#organizing-md-files-markdown-files)

- You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.

<br/>

### _Bold_

- To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

```
i am **here**.<br>
or, i**am**here. (without spaces).
```

_`Output`_

i am **here**.<br>
or, i**am**here. (without spaces).

<br/>

### _Italic_

- - To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

```
i am *here*.<br>
or, i*am*here. (without spaces).
```

_`Output`_

i am _here_.<br>
or, i*am*here. (without spaces).

<br/>

### _Bold and Italic_

- To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters.

```
i am ***here***.<br>
or, i<b><i>am</b></i>here. (without spaces).<br>
```

_`Output`_

i am **_here_**.<br>
or, i<b><i>am</b></i>here. (without spaces).<br>

## Blockquotes [..](https://github.com/aIqasem/md-files-formatting#organizing-md-files-markdown-files)

- To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

```
> This is a blockquotes
```

_`Output`_

> This is a blockquotes

<br/>

### _Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs_

- Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

```
> 1st Line of the block.
>
> 2nd one.
```

_`Output`_

> 1st Line of the block.
>
> 2nd one.

<br/>

### _Nested Blockquotes_

- Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

```
> start
>
> > this is a nested block.
>
> end
```

_`Output`_

> start
>
> > this is a nested block.
>
> end

<br/>

### _Blockquotes with Other Elements_

- looks nice? have a try

```
> try this
>
> - this is a line starting with a dot.
```

_`Output`_

> try this
>
> - this is a line starting with a dot.

## Lists [..](https://github.com/aIqasem/md-files-formatting#organizing-md-files-markdown-files)

- You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists.

<br/>

### _Ordered Lists_

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers donâ€™t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

```
1. 1st Line.<br>
2. 2nd Line.<br>
3. 3rd Line.<br>
```

_`Output`_

1. 1st Line.<br>
2. 2nd Line.<br>
3. 3rd Line.<br>

<br/>

### _Unordered Lists_

- To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (\*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

```
- 1st.<br>
- 2nd.<br>
- 3rd.<br>
- - 4th (nested).<br>
```

_`Output`_

- 1st.<br>
- 2nd.<br>
- 3rd.<br>
- - 4th (nested).<br>

<br/>

- To start an unordered list with a number .. use `\` before the `.`

```
- 1st.<br>
- 2nd.<br>
- 3rd.<br>
- 4\. 4th (Starting with a number) .<br>
```

_`Output`_

- 1st.<br>
- 2nd.<br>
- 3rd.<br>
- 4\. 4th (Starting with a number) .<br>

<br/>

### _Paragraph inside a list_

- Start the paragraph with 2 spaces.

```
- 1st<br>
- 2nd <br>

  this is a test paragraph<br>

- 3rd<br>
```

_`Output`_

- 1st<br>
- 2nd <br>

  this is a test paragraph<br>

- 3rd<br>

<br/>

### _Blockquote inside a list_

- Start the line with 2 spaces.

```
- test<br>
- test<br>

  > this is s block quote.<br>

- test
```

_`Output`_

- test<br>
- test<br>

  > this is s block quote.<br>

- test
